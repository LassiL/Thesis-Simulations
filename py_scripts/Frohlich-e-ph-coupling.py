#%% Fr√∂hlich coupling between electrons and longitudinal optical phonons
    # - Note this assumes low temperature s.t. no phonons are thermally excited
    # - I.e., neglecting the stimulated emission by electrons in Fermi's golden rule
    # - This is not completely valid as energy of a LO phonon in InSb is 24 meV and k_BT(300K) = 25 meV
    # - See Mahan book for better theories

#Note this coupling rate is twice what I have in my H.O. eqn - remove the factor of two
