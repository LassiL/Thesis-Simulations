Experimental phonon frequencies at Gamma: 
LO 197 \pm 8 cm-1
TO 185 \pm 2 cm-1 (Kartheuser 1972, Marder book)

Tutorial RF2

I have run the simulation for: 
acell 3*12.181502674   # ngkpt 4x4x4 (8x8x8) Monkhorst
ngkpt  4 4 4 # Somewhere I read this is 8x8x8 monkhorst
ecut   42          # Maximal kinetic energy cut-off, in Hartree

Which took 
- Proc.   0 individual time (sec): cpu=      36441.3  wall=      65976.1
i.e., 10 hours on each of 8 processor cores ...
(Probably will not run for higher ngkpt ...)

Born-effective:

Sb: -2.2512455791

Frequencies at Gamma
w_LO = 187.8455 cm-1
w_TO = 179.6503 cm-1

ANALYSIS: 

1. Generation of a derivative database
Files: Ph_1.in
	$ mpirun -n 8 abinit Ph_1.abi >& log 2> err &

2. Manipulation of the derivative databases (the MRGDDB utility)
Files: Ph_1MRGDDB.in

	$ mrgddb < Ph_1MRGDDB.in
	
Out: Ph_1MRGDDB.ddb.out

3. Computation of phonon band structures with efficient interpolation
Plotting with abipy:

# Copy the tutorial output file to have the correct file extension (DDB)
# otherwise abiview does not know how to handle our file.
	$ cp Ph_1MRGDDB.ddb.out Ph_1MRGDDB_DDB
	
	$ abiview.py ddb Ph_1MRGDDB_DDB -sns=talk
	
Finally, plot with Miranda: http://henriquemiranda.github.io/phononwebsite/

	$ abiopen.py Ph_1MRGDDB_DDB

In [1]: phbst, phdos = abifile.anaget_phbst_and_phdos_files()
In [2]: phbst.phbands.view_phononwebsite()

Which opens the website. This also saves .json file to the current working directory of
the base environment terminal.
