run with: 
    $ mpirun -n 8 abinit CNVG_*.abi >& log 2> err

Optimizing the lattice constant looped over:
ngkpt1  4 4 4 
ngkpt2  6 6 6 
ngkpt3  8 8 8 
for a constant ecut, which will be changed by hand (36,42,48)

Write down the forces between the atoms
I am converging respect to
tolmxf 5.0d-6
tolvrs 1.0d-16

Note: abipy can plot convergence with 
    $ abiopen.py CNVG_*o_DS*_HIST.nc --expose --seaborn
