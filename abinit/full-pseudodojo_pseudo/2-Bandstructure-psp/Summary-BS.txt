Experimental band gap is 0.17 eV at 300 K
X-valley = 1.0 eV
L-valley = 0.68 eV
Spin-orbit = 0.8 eV

run with: 
    $ mpirun -n 8 abinit BS_*.abi >& log 2> err &

To view the bands either:

1. In iPython (gives freedom to modify the plot a bit)

	$ from abipy.abilab import abiopen
	$ file = "BS_*o_DS2_GSR.nc"
	$ with abiopen(file) as ncfile:
		ebands = ncfile.ebands
	$ebands.plot(with_gaps=False, ylims=[-5,5])

Or directly
2. 
	$ abiopen.py BS_*o_DS2_GSR.nc --expose -sns=talk

# Probably rerun, but use 8x8x8 shiftk at 42 ecut
# Should always use the corresponding lattice constant
