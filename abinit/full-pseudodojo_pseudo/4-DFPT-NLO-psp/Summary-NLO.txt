Using the full DFPT method only available with PAW pseudos [Gonze 2020] or [Romero 2020]
Do after doing the PEAD method - this method doesn't need a strain calculation

Have only been able to run with ngkpt 4 4 4 in Ph_1.abi

Born effective charge is around 2.2 see Landolt-Börnstein InSb

Raman polarizability is 
	alpha = Omega_0 * d\chi/d\tau = 70 Å^2 (some phys rev paper)

From Kartheuser 1972, (or Marder)
Price 1971 lattice dynamics of grey tin and indium antimonide
w_LO = 197 cm-1 and w_TO = 185 cm-1
eps(inf) = 15.68 and eps(0) = 17.88

Cardona raman gives 190 and 180 cm-1

Check the LST relation for for the high-frequency dielectric constant
	eps(inf) = w(TO)^2/w(LO)^2*eps(0)

To run the simulations: 
	1. NLO_1.abi

		$ mpirun -n 8 abinit NLO_1.abi >& log 2> err &

		- builds databases for second and third energy derivatives with respect to electric fields, atomic displacements
		1. self-consistent calculation of the ground state in the IBZ
		2. non self-consistent calculation to get the wavefuctions over the full BZ (or half BZ)
		3. Computation of the derivatise of the wfs respect to k-points using DFPT
		4. 2nd derivatives of the energy and related 1st order wfs with respect to electric field, atomic displacements
		5. 3rd derivative calculations
	- Only consider valence bands i.e., (no electrons)/2
		- nbands 14 for psp
	- Perhaps apply dfpt_sciss 0.17 eV after rfelfd 3

	2. NLO_1MRGDDB.abi
		- merge the DDBs provided in the steps 2 and 3
			$ mrgddb < NLO_1MRGDDB.abi
		Note the merged datasets are 4 and 7

 	5. NLO_1ANADDB.abi
		- ANADDB analysis file
		- has to be accompanied with NLO_1ANADDB.files
			$ anaddb < NLO_1ANADDB.files

Finally, NLO_1ANADDB.abo produced by the ANADDB will contain the all the results above!

Notes: dieflag 1, in nlo_5.abi for ANADDB, will calculate the frequency dependent dielectric function and save it in a separate file

Also, can plot the raman spectra by:
	$ python Raman_spec.py InSb.input
where the input file is something like,

(Need to move the python script to somewhere?)
