Experimental band gap is 0.17 eV at 300 K
X-valley = 1.0 eV
L-valley = 0.68 eV
Spin-orbit = 0.8 eV

To view the bands either:

1. In iPython (gives freedom to modify the plot a bit)

	$ from abipy.abilab import abiopen
	$ filename = "BS_*o_DS2_GSR.nc"
	$ with abiopen(filename) as ncfile:
		ebands = ncfile.ebands
	$ ebands.plot(with_gaps=False, ylims=[-5,5])

Or directly
2. 
	$ abiopen.py BS_*o_DS2_GSR.nc --expose -sns=talk
