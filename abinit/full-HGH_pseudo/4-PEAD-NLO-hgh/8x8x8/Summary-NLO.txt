Using the Veithen (2005) PEAD method and not the full DFPT (which needs PAW pseudos)

Born effective charge is around 2.2 see Landolt-Börnstein InSb

Raman polarizability is alpha = Omega_0 * d\chi/d\tau = 70 Å^2 (some phys rev paper)

From Kartheuser 1972, (or Marder) 
w_LO = 197 cm-1 and w_TO = 185 cm-1
eps(inf) = 15.68 and eps(0) = 17.88

Check the LST relation for for the high-frequency dielectric constant
	eps(inf) = w(TO)^2/w(LO)^2*eps(0)

To run the simulations: 
	1. NLO_1.abi (not necessary)
		- could use this to optimize the geometry

	2. NLO_2.abi
		To run: 
			$ mpirun -n 8 abinit NLO_2.abi >& log 2> err &

		- builds databases for second and third energy derivatives with respect to electric fields, atomic displacements
		1. self-consistent calculation of the ground state in the IBZ
		2. non self-consistent calculation to get the wavefuctions over the full BZ (or half BZ)
		3. Computation of the derivatise of the wfs respect to k-points using DFPT
		4. 2nd derivatives of the energy and related 1st order wfs with respect to electric field, atomic displacements
		5. 3rd derivative calculations
	- Only consider valence bands i.e., (no electrons)/2
		- nbands 4 for hgh

	3. NLO_3.abi
		To run: 
			$ mpirun -n 8 abinit NLO_3.abi >& log 2> err &

		- just calculates the strain response, to be added to above

	4. NLO_4.abi
		- merge the DDBs provided in the steps 2 and 3
		To run: 
			mrgddb < NLO_4.abi

	5. NLO_5.abi
		To run: 
			$ anaddb < NLO_5.files
		- ANADDB analysis file
		- has to be accompanied with NLO_5.files

Finally, NLO_5.abo produced by the ANADDB will contain the all the results above!

Notes: dieflag 1, in NLO_5.abi for ANADDB, will calculate the frequency dependent dielectric function and save it in a separate file

Also, can plot the raman spectra by:
	$ python Raman_spec.py InSb.input
where the input file is something like,

(Need to move the python script to somewhere?)
