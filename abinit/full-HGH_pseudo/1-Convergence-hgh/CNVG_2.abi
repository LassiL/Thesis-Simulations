##### SCF PROCEDURE #####
nstep 100         # Maximal number of SCF cycles
                  # Can go even more

# TOLERANCE PARAMETERS
# Will cause one SCF cycle to stop when (and ions to be moved)
# When reached twice in a row

#use either of these two for geometrical optimization

tolvrs 1.0d-16
#toldff 5.0d-6    # Hartree/bohr, suggested value, alternatively use below
#tolrff 0.02       # Suggested value
