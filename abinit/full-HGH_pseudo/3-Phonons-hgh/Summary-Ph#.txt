Experimental phonon frequencies at Gamma: 
LO 197 \pm 8 cm-1
TO 185 \pm 2 cm-1 (Kartheuser 1972, Marder book)
and Price neutron diffraction 
(1971 Price et al lattice dynamics of grey tin and indium)

Raman by cardona gives 190 and 180 cm-1

Contain 3 simulations at fixed ecut 25
	Ph_1      Ph_2      Ph_3
	4x4x4 and 6x6x6 and 8x8x8
and the corresponding lattice constants

Tutorial RF2

1. Generation of a derivative database
Files: Ph_*.in

2. Manipulation of the derivative databases (the MRGDDB utility)
Files: Ph_*MRGDDB.in

	$ mrgddb < Ph_*MRGDDB.in
	
Out: Ph_*MRGDDB.ddb.out

3. Computation of phonon band structures with efficient interpolation
Plotting with abipy:

# Copy the tutorial output file to have the correct file extension (DDB)
# otherwise abiview does not know how to handle our file.
	$ cp Ph_*MRGDDB.ddb.out Ph_*MRGDDB_DDB
	
	$ abiview.py ddb Ph_*MRGDDB_DDB -sns=talk
	
Finally, plot with Miranda: http://henriquemiranda.github.io/phononwebsite/

	$ abiopen.py Ph_*MRGDDB_DDB
